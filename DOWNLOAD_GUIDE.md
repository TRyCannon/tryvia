# Download TRYVIA Files for GitHub Upload

Since Replit's Git integration is having issues, here's how to manually get your TRYVIA code to GitHub:

## Method 1: Download Essential Files

### Files to Download (Right-click > Download):

**Main Folders:**
- `client/` (entire folder - your React frontend)
- `server/` (entire folder - your Express backend)  
- `shared/` (entire folder - database schema)

**Root Files:**
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tailwind.config.ts`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `postcss.config.js`
- `components.json`
- `drizzle.config.ts`
- `README.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `GITHUB_SETUP.md`
- `DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md` (this file)

### Skip These (They're Large/Unnecessary):
- `node_modules/` (387MB - regenerated with npm install)
- `.git/` folder
- `.replit`, `.gitignore` files

## Method 2: Create Files Manually on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/TRyCannon/tryvia
2. Click "Add file" > "Create new file"
3. Create folder structure by typing: `client/src/App.tsx`
4. Copy-paste file contents from Replit
5. Repeat for all files

## Method 3: Use GitHub's Upload Feature

1. Download files as described above
2. Go to https://github.com/TRyCannon/tryvia  
3. Click "uploading an existing file"
4. Drag and drop your folders/files
5. Commit with message: "Initial commit: TRYVIA live trivia game"

## After Upload to GitHub

Anyone can run your project with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TRyCannon/tryvia.git
cd tryvia
npm install
npm run db:push
npm run dev
```

Your TRYVIA project is complete and ready for GitHub!
